### Project 1: NHL Game Prediction in R
This project aims to predict winning NHL teams using machine learning models. The study utilized data from the NHL Game Data available on Kaggle, which consisted of two datasets: game.csv and game_teams_stats.csv. This project involves data cleaning, exploratory analysis, and model building, with XGBoost identified as the best-performing model. The findings of the study indicate the potential of machine learning models in predicting winning NHL teams and can be useful for stakeholders in the sports industry, particularly in game strategy.
