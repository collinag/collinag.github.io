## Projects

### Project 1: NHL Game Prediction in R
This project aims to predict winning NHL teams using machine learning models. The study utilized data from the NHL Game Data available on Kaggle, which consisted of two datasets: game.csv and game_teams_stats.csv. This project involves data cleaning, exploratory analysis, and model building, with XGBoost identified as the best-performing model. The findings of the study indicate the potential of machine learning models in predicting winning NHL teams and can be useful for stakeholders in the sports industry, particularly in game strategy.

### Project 2: Movie Rating Recommendation Prediction
This project aims to use matrix factorization
and random forest models to find the best prediction of movie
recommendations based off prior movie and user data. This project
was conducted using a dataset containing 100,000 observations,
which consisted of user ratings of movies.

### Project 3: Nottingham England Air Temperature Time Series
In this project, I will be exploring the nottem dataset in R and will create time series models based on this data. The nottem dataset contains the average air temperatures in Nottingham, England from 1920 to 1939, recorded monthly.
